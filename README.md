# CLASSP
 A Biologically-Inspired Approach to Continual Learning through Adjustment Suppression and Sparsity Promotion

This repository hosts the code for CLASSP, a unique continual learning approach inspired by biological learning principles. CLASSP addresses catastrophic forgetting by balancing the acquisition of new information with the preservation of past knowledge. This balance is achieved via two primary mechanisms: a decay rate for weight updates and a threshold on the loss gradient. The decay rate assigns lower learning rates to frequently updated weights, thereby maintaining their relevance to previous tasks. The threshold encourages sparsity, reserving capacity for future tasks. If you use ideas or code from this repository in a publication, please cite our paper DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.20942.06724
